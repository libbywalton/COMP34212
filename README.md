Filtering:

- The dataset is obtained from https://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/ where it is then filtered using the code in filtering-images.py to obtain the cropped three-channel uint8 RGB images.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

- The dataset obtained is used in training a MLP, CNN and transformer for object recognition.
- Hyperparemeters such as batch size, epochs and many more are investigated.
